# Central Traffic

A playable browser-based traffic strategy simulation. The React UI observes a deterministic TypeScript simulation engine and emits serializable player actions, so the same simulator can run in-browser, headlessly, by heuristic controllers, and later by ML controllers.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build
npm run simulate -- --runs=10 --controller=reactive
```

## Architecture

- `src/simulation`: deterministic, render-independent traffic engine.
- `src/components`: React control-center UI.
- `src/rendering`: canvas drawing only, no simulation logic.
- `scripts/simulate.ts`: headless runs for baseline/reactive controllers.
- `scripts/benchmark.ts`: 5,000 vehicle tick benchmark.
