# Architecture

The simulation engine is independent from React and rendering.

```ts
const sim = new SimulationEngine(config);
sim.reset(seed);
sim.step(action);
const state = sim.getState();
const reward = sim.getReward();
```

React creates serializable `SimulationAction` objects and reads observations. Canvas rendering consumes graph and vehicle state but does not update traffic.
